    <h1 style="text-align:center;">My Favorite Hobbies</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 5%;">I have plenty of hobbies that I enjoy doing. I will list a few of my hobbies below.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
        <div style="background-color: #FFFFFF; color: #2B2B2B;">
            <h4>Networking</h4>
            <p>Networking caught my eye because all technology is connected to a network. I enjoyed
                resolving simple issues in my household when it came to fixing the internet. I started
                unplugging the router for 10 - 30 seconds and the Wi-Fi magically worked. After diving
                deeper into networking, I learned how to set static IP addresses. I have been trying to get
                back at using Packet Tracer to continue and improve my knowledge when having to connect
                PCs, routers, switches, servers, firewalls, IoTs, and potentially use the cloud.</p>

            <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>I took a course about Security and I enjoyed learning the basics. I decided to go
                further with the learning. I am currently using TryHackMe to learn the basics of
                "Hacking". I am mainly focusing on defense penetration. Cybersecurity is the future
                and I want to be part of this future. In my free time, I try my best to complete a
                couple of activities to keep me in the loop. I am also learning Kali Linux for pen-
                testing.</p>

            <h4>Playing Video Games</h4>
            <p>I enjoy playing video games to distract me from the real world. It also allows me to have a great time
                with my friends.</p>
        </div>

            <h4>Enjoying Nature</h4>
            <p>At the time, I like getting away from technology. I sometimes go for a walk or go outside
                and sit while hearing the birds during spring and summer. I haven't gone camping for
                a few years now. I enjoyed camping with my family.</p>

            <h4>Investing</h4>
            <p> This is relatively one of my newest hobbies. I started investing in 2019 with $100.
                Who doesn't like making money on the side? I got into investing in March 2020.
                I am learning how the market functions. I am still learning. But it's fun seeing your
                investment grow and decline.</p>
